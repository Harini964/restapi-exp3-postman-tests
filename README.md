In this section, I tested the GET and POST requests of the server created in the experiment using Postman. Below are the corresponding screenshots of the requests and the responses received:

1. POST Request

In the first screenshot, a POST request is made to the endpoint http://localhost:3000/api/post-data. A sample JSON body is sent, and the server responds with a 201 Created status, along with the echoed data from the request. This demonstrates how the server handles incoming POST requests and successfully parses JSON data.

2. GET Request

In the second screenshot, a GET request is sent to the endpoint http://localhost:3000/api/get-data. The server returns a 200 OK status, along with a success message. This shows the server's ability to respond to GET requests.
